  Welcome to the PKU Pokemon Database Editor!
  <br></br>
  In this repository you will find the source code for this Database Editor (which is written in C# using WinForm) and a seperate executable.
  <br></br>
  With this Editor you can import already existing PokemonDatabase.cs files and edit them to your own liking.
  If you're done editing the Database you can temporarily save it into an .xml file or export it into a PokemonDatabase.cs to use in your own project.
